Adding or removing accounts:

	Adding a new account
		On the puppet master, go to /etc/puppet/modules/users and open up init.pp
		Insert the user / key information using the template below. This will create a user account on the instance.

	user { 'USERNAME':
		ensure  => 'present',
		groups  => ['classmate'],
		shell   => '/bin/bash',
        	purge_ssh_keys => true,
	    	managehome => true,
		home   => '/home/USER_NAME',
	}
	ssh_authorized_key {'USER_NAME':
		type    => 'ssh-rsa',
		user    => 'USER_NAME',
		key     => 'Whatever_the_key_is',
	}

       c. Then, navigate to /etc/puppet/modules/fakefreeze. 
       d. Open up init.pp in an editor and add the following code to the class:

  	cron { 'clean USERNAME':
    		command => 'find /tmp -user USERNAME -delete && find /var/tmp -user USERNAME -delete',
    	user => 'root',
    hour => '23',
  }
 
This will delete any user files stored in temp directories
	      e. Finally, navigate to /etc/puppet/manifest, open up site.pp and add the following code to node ip-10-0-7-222:

        cron{ "sync USER_NAME	":
                command => "rsync -avL --progress -e "ssh -i /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pem" /etc/puppet/modules/fakefreeze/files/ root@10-0-7-246:/home/USER_NAME",
		user => "ubuntu",
		hour => "23",
        }


Deleting an account
In addition to standard Unix user deletion, you must also follow the steps above and delete the code sections mentioned above.
