User ReadMe

This is a learning environment. What this entails is that you are welcome to edit any files that you see fit. Only in your home directory will you be able to actually create files. Remember that all of you changes are TEMPORARY. What this means is that at 11:00- 11:30 pm PT each night, the system will be closed for maintenance and all of your changes and new files will be erased, and the system will be restored to its initial state. If you wish to keep your changes, make sure to save them locally. If you save a file on this system, it will be saved UNTIL 11:00, at which point it will be erased. Have fun using the system, and hopefully learn something.
